Description: This package are grounded in a branch of spatial statistics. Using geographically weights, the geographically weighted panel regression is try to solve the residuals from panel regression clustering spatially. To investigate whether the residuals cluster spatially, the Moran's I test is also improved. Furthermore, three local statistic tests are contained to help the users select model.
